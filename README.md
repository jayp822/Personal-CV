### Personal-CV For Web Programming Class

This project was an assignment in my CSCI 4300 Web Programming class where the instructor gave an outline for a cover letter website that I followed. My website is built and designed using HTML and CSS.

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
